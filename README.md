> This project aims to train a character-level language model to generate names in Traditional Chinese for people. We downloaded the name list from the website “A List of Chinese Names”(http://technology.chtsai.org/namelist/) as the training dataset. We used Karpathy’s template as a base. Since our data is not Latin-based, there are some changes we had made to get the model to work, such as installment of mpl-tc-fonts to visualize Traditional Chinese characters in the plot. 

## Install

pip install git+https://github.com/Hsins/mpl-tc-fonts.git
